# Little script to retrieve files with scp.
# Files:
# 	hosts.cnf -> list of files to be retrieved. Use a line like this:
			user@host:password:/route/to/the/file
			** NOTE: this has some security issues. use at your own risk.
	recopilatron.sh -> executable itself. You have to configure it before use. Edit the file and you will see the variables documented.
